### WordPress Reactivate Cards

Creates "card" shapes that can have customized text, a selected photo, and a list of links.

This WordPress plugin is built off of pangolin's [Reactivate](https://github.com/gopangolin/wp-reactivate),a React boilerplate. Credits to pangolin's publically available code and tutorial.

### WordPress Plugin Usage

To use this plugin use shortcode [wpr-cards]

The shortcode uses the following 7 parameters: [wpr-cards title="" title_url="" image_src="" subtitle="" resource_desc="" resource_links="" height=""]

"resource_desc" and "resource_links" are both strings that have each resource separated by a comma.

ex: [wpr-cards title="AAUW" title_url="https://www.aauw.org/" image_src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/American_Association_of_University_Women_logo.svg/1920px-American_Association_of_University_Women_logo.svg.png" subtitle="organization" resource_desc="Graduating to a Pay Gap (2012),Why So Few? (2010)" resource_links="http://witi.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Graduating-To-A-Pay-Gap-AAUW-2012.pdf,http://witi.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Why-So-Few-AAUW-2010.pdf" height="150px"]

Developed by Antonio Franco using React.js and pangolin's WP Reactivate boilerplate in June 2019.
